## How it works

This is an interactive Go tutorial meant to be used in conjunctions with other people.
Go through the `levelX.go` files and compare your progress with others.

Each level will give you the opportunity to learn about different aspects of Go:
- Level 1: basic syntax, loops, conditions and string building
- Level 2: structs and defer
- Level 3: JSON marshalling/unmarshalling, HTTP servers and clients

Have fun!
